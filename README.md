#Retic Controller App

This app is designed to provide a comfortable and modern user interface to schedule and control a home retic system. It currently relies on manual configuration of a Raspberry Pi to host a web server, being on the same network as the Pi, and editing the code to set the correct IP address of Pi. In the future, I hope to modify this to use a cloud-based design.
